# B10K
I am excited to join in the part of B10K and this program is the process of my own learning experience. This is a huge challenge to me, which remind me the tough and invincible character in 《the old man and the sea》

“We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.”
